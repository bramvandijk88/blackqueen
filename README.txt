This is the source code for the model discussed in "Interaction range determines the structure and dynamics of Black Queen ecosystems". This repository contains
the full model (BQ_full.js), which can be run from the command-line:

> node bq_full <ARGS>

This requires the installation of Node (tested with v16.14.0), which uses the Chrome V8 enginge to run Javascript code at high performance. 

A second js file called bq_online.js contains the code for the interactive version of the model available online.
