    EXAMPLE FILE Cheater (HTML)

    This HTML file is different from other examples like GoL and prime, because
    instead of defining the model within the HTML itself, it merely includes the javascript
    code called cheater.js. The benefit of this is that you can easily
    swap between running your code interactively (in the browser), or just running
    the raw code on the commandline via 'nodejs cheater.js'. 

    Apart from this difference, the HTML file is identical.

                All cells in a Moore neighbourhood of an empty space will have a chance to reproduce into that space.
                Cells that produce fewer goods have a greater chance of reproduction, provided they have access to all CGs.
                Cells within a certain interaction range can provide CGs to the focal (center) cell.
                HGT can change the genomic loci of neighbouring cells. 
                This includes gaining new genes (activation), but also functional alleles being overwritten by non-functional 
                alleles (inactivation).
